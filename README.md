Classes
The project defines three classes:

Car: Represents a car with model, value, and condition attributes.
Customer, Employee, Manager: Derived classes from the User class, each with specific functionalities.

File Handling
The system loads and saves data using file handling. Custs.txt( FORMAT:: NAME <newline> ID <newline> PASSWORD <newline> rent_limit <newline> rent_score <newline> rented_cars *comma separated* ), 
Employees.txt( FORMAT:: NAME <newline> ID <newline> PASSWORD <newline> rent_limit <newline> rent_score <newline> rented_cars *comma separated* ), Managers.txt( FORMAT NAME <newline> ID <newline> PASSWORD), Cars.txt(Garage cars comma separated), CarOwner.txt(FORMAT:: CAR <newline> OWNER), and Allcars.txt(FORMAT:: CAR <newline> value <newline> condition(0% to 100%)) store user information, car details, and rental information.

Data Persistence
User and car information is stored persistently in text files. The system reads this data at startup and updates the files when users perform actions like renting, returning, or administrative tasks.

Build and Run
Compile the C++ code using a C++ compiler to build and run the project. For example, using g++:

bash
Copy code
g++ -o car_rental_system car_rental_system.cpp
./car_rental_system
